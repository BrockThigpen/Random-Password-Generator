After the generate button has been clicked this application will ask the user for input on password length, the use of lowercase letters, the use of uppercase letters, the use of numbers, and the use of symbols. If the user input is valid, the application will provide a truely random password that meets the user's requirements. The user will then have the option to use the copy to clipboard button, or if the user is not satisfied with the generated password, they can generate a new password. 

In the future I would like to add a feature that allows the user to access perviously generated passwords.
